# FEATURE DETECTION AND MATCHING
One of the most popular algorithms in image processing is Scale Invariant Feature Extraction or SIFT. This algorithm detects features that are invariant to image scale or rotation.
Moreover, features are local and based on the appearance of the object in certain interesting points. They are also robust to changes in illumination, noise, and minor changes in viewpoint.
